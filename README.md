# My Implementation of Various Data Structures, Algorithms and Common Programming Problems

This repository contains my hands-on implementations, using the C programming language, of common data structures, algorithms, and solutions to famous coding problems. It is for educational purposes only and not intended to be used for any professional purpose. It is not structured like a professional C project where you have source, header and binary files stored in separate directories. Rather, each source file is intended to be a whole stand-alone program.

The code here is covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means you are free to do whatever you want with the code. Review the license terms (included in the repo) to know more.
